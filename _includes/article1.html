    <h1>Hey!</h1>
    After doing few tutorials (mainly <a href="http://travisneilson.com/" target="_blank">Travis Neilson</a> and his Dev Tips), I decided to take next step in my learning course. Soon I will
    graduate in architecture, and move to Norway from Poland. I created this site to have place, where
    I can put my snippets of code. But the major change in my attitude is that I want
    to try code my own designs. Although they will be rather simple designs in the beginning.

    <h1>So... This is my 1st design</h1>

    Lastly I discovered Adobe XD when I was watching one
    of a video of great polish  youtuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCq8XmOMtrUCb8FcFHQEd8_g" target="_blank">Hello Roman</a>.
    Totally free program sounded great  for me, and with my 2 programs Affinity Designer and Affinity Photo
    they will be great mix for making 2d graphics. <br>

    <br> Yes, I know this design looks like a little... <h1>...CRAP</h1>

    But it was important to me to learn code design not using tutorial, and... it
    really worked for myself. I learned many things, that I haven't been aware of. For instance how
    much box-sizing: border box is important etc. I hope next design will be better. Greetz! <br><br>

    PS1. Buttons style by Federico Dossena and his superb article on his site <a href="https://fdossena.com/?p=html5cool/buttons/i.frag" target="_blank">fdossena.com</a> and icon
    near article title by <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/authors/freepik" target="_blank"> freepik</a>.

    <br><br> PS2. I forgot to mention, that general design of this site (Creepy Code, not 1st design) is
    based on Travis Neilson' Dev Tips <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJhhLvW-Xvg&list=PLqGj3iMvMa4KeBN2krBtcO3U90_7SOl-A" target="_blank"> tutorial </a>called
    "Design + Code my Personal Website" and it's fueled by <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank"> jekyll</a>.
