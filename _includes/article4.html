    <h1>Ol√°!</h1>
    Some time ago I started creating my personal portfolio website, when I want publish my projects.
    First step to make was header section, which I designed using Adobe XD. General idea was really obvious
    to me. I used to play in a band, so in Affinity Designer (great program for vector graphics) I
    designed instruments and came with "catchy" slogan "Never too old to rock... with websites" <br><br>

    Header's design had 2 versions. First one was really colorful with main yellow color. I liked it at first,
    but after some time I realised It's maybe too cartoony... <br>

    <img id="header-yellow"  src="assets/img/header-yellow.png">

    ...so I came up with more simple version. Yellow color was replaced by red-blue gradient, and
    I changed colors of instruments' graphics to white and dark blue. <br>
    <img id="header-red"  src="assets/img/header-red.png">

    Coding that header was rather time-consuming than hard, mainly beacuse I wanted to make it
    full responsive. I created burger menu adjusting Traversy Media

    a lot from it. Thanks for reading! Ha det bra!
