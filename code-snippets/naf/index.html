        <h1>Oh, so they have Internet on computers now!</h1>
I'm a Spalding Gray in a Rick Dees world. I didn't think it was physically possible, but this both sucks *and* blows. Dear Mr. President, There are too many states nowadays. Please, eliminate three. P.S. I am not a crackpot.

Facts are meaningless. You could use facts to prove anything that's even remotely true! Remember the time he ate my goldfish? And you lied and said I never had goldfish. Then why did I have the bowl, Bart? *Why did I have the bowl?

<h2>Get ready, skanks! It's time for the truth train!</h2>
Ahoy hoy? I'll keep it short and sweet — Family. Religion. Friendship. These are the three demons you must slay if you wish to succeed in business. Fat Tony is a cancer on this fair city! He is the cancer and I am the…uh…what cures cancer?

"Thank the Lord"? That sounded like a prayer. A prayer in a public school. God has no place within these walls, just like facts don't have a place within an organized religion.
Marge, it takes two to lie. One to lie and one to listen.
I'm going to the back seat of my car, with the woman I love, and I won't be back for ten minutes!
